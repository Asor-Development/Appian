# Records
**Records in a database or spreadsheet are usually single rows of data that only give you a one dimensional view of the data, but appian records takes that data to the next level. Appian Records enable you to access, organize, and take action on it in a consistent way, you can converge your data into a single point of management within your application.**
- allow you to easily adjust your data model


## Actionable
- Appian Records are a actionable view of related data
- users can take informed action when viewing the data
    - using sites, tempo, or their organizations web pages that have embedded interfaces
    - actions and related actions are defined in records

## Source of Data
- record data can come from a number of places (relation databases, appian processes and web services)
- consolidates siloed data and disparate systems by connecting and integrating information from multiple data sources
- relation databases are usually use because they store data efficiently 


## Record Data Sync
- allows Appian to cache a copy of the external data
- this way the record type only has to query the synced data instead of an external source, allowing users to view data and complete tasks more quickly, this hepls with performace
- querying will be faster
- when getting data from some sort of API you can configure data to sync at certain time depending on your business requirment
- When you enable data sync, you can apply record-level security to specify who can view each record


## Define how users view your data
- you can set up a record list or read only grids for users to view and navigate a set of records
- multiple views can be set up for the applications users allowing them to see the data that is most important to them
- records should be designed in a way that users can quickly understand everthing in it and find what they need and act on it
- can add custom record fields to your records to make easy data calculations and manipulations, allowing you to then reference these fields as easily as any other record field, to build reports, grids, queries, and more

## Record Best Practices
- as a best practice records should be built first and the processes should be built aroud them
