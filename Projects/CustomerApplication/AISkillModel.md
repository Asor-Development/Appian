# Create and Train the AI Skill Model
- train AI Skill model to learn based on documents we provide it
- there are two different document types
    - the model has to go through the documents and learn and train itself
    - it is a good idea to do this at the start, so when the time comes to implement it into a process, the document classification is already trained and ready to use
    
1. Create a new AI Skill Object
    - select Document Classification
2. Create First Model
    - select Create First Model ---> New Document Type
        - Give the document a name
        - give at least 10 documents, the more the better
        - all document should be a unique PDF file
        - Click Create and Add Another and do repeat these steps to add another document type
        - Save Changes when done
        - Click **Train Model**
