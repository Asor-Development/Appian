- databse Structures always need to be built first
- columns that should always be used
    - createdBy, createdOn, modifiedBy, modifiedOn,and isActive
- primary key identifies a row of data, without a primary key when we try to update a row it will create a new row instead of updating
- if a column is not marked null we will get an error if we try to enter a row of data that does not contain data for that column
