- team decides what stories they’ll tackle that sprint
- discuss the requirements and functionality that each user story requires
- an opportunity to get technical and creative in the team’s implementation of the story
- score the stories based on their complexity or time to completion
    - teams can use t-shirt sizes, the Fibonacci sequence, or planning poker to make proper estimations
    - story should be sized to complete in one sprint
